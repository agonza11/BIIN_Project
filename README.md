The 8 major crops that keep America Moving are Corn, Upland Cotton, Soybeans, Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rice, Sorghum
This project focuses on Corn, Upland Cotton, and Soybeans and only uses USDA collected data

The ultimate goal is to create a website with a database that does the following
  1. Provides historic data (1990-2018) on crop production per state
  2. Provides historic data (2000-2018) on GM crop adoption rates per state
  3. Provides historic data (1990-2018) on herbicide usage in LBs per state
  4. Provides predictive data (2019-2024) on crop production for the nation
  5. Creates graphs showing GM crop adoption rates along with the amount of herbicide used or crop production
  6. Teach people about GMOs and provide a general framework for people to make educated decisions as to the effectiveness of GMOS
  7. Create a timeline of GMO usage in the USA
  
This project can't make direct correlations but I hope to show that as GMO adoption rates rise that there is a noticable change in
either the production of crops or a noticeable change in the amount of herbicides used. In essence its an ad hoc experiment but I
am with holding my personal views as I want visitors to come to the website with preconcived notions on GMOs and want to provide
them unbaised facts so that they can further educate themselves on GMOs.
