    <h2>The Current Global Dilema</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">The scientific community relies upon facts to help guide lawmakers and world leaders. Some such facts are that the world's population is growing, and with it so must progress and innovation. With increases in population comes need for increases in food production. Increasing population also means the world will be producing more carbon dioxide. Ever since the industrial age scientists have viewed an increase in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide found in our atmosphere. As time goes on one can only assume that more carbon dioxide will accumulate and henceforth any related symptoms of having increasing carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. These facts present challenges that will have to be faced in the future, but there maybe a way to fix start mending these problems now. What if we could create crops which relied more heavily on carbon dioxide to sustain life? These crops in theory would provide a simple solution that could help in tandem with our growing populations. The answer is genetically modified crops.</p>
    <center> <h4> Why are GMO's so important in today's society? What ever happened to the old way of doing things?</h4> </center>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">The United States of America is known for its farming states. Keeping that in mind the country pays close attention to the amount and quality of food which it produces agriculturally. The modern world has a population of approximately 7.7 billion people, all of which need to eat in order to survive. According to the US Census Bureau, they estimate that there are 247,813,910 adults living in the United States, and that the total population is estimated at 321,418,820 people, as of 2019. In particular the United States Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, has catagorized the nations eight most important crops. In no particular order they are as follows: </p>

    <h4> The United States Eight Most Important Crops </h4>
    <p>Corn, Wheat, Sorghum, Rice, Barley, Upland Cotton, Oats, Soybeans</p>
    </center>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to feed the average U.S. citizen it requires roughly 1 acre per year. The crops which this website focuses on are in many regards thought to be America's greatest assests: Corn, Upland Cotton, and Soybeans. Corn makes up a large amount of the foods and products we use daily. Corn can be cooked, processed, distilled, and refined to fit into almost any and all pre-packaged foods we find in our local supermarkets. Corn can be made into cattle feed, grain alcohol, a binding agent for many chemicals, citric acid, vanilla extract, di-glycerides, and most common of all high-fructose corn syrup! Upland cotton is a certain type of cotton which produces large amount of fibers which are used in textiles and manufacturing. The reason for Upland Cotton's popularity in the U.S. is due to it's lineage. Upland Cotton is a native species of the Americas. Soybeans are mainly processed for their oils which are combined with a large number of food products. Soybeans also provide a high-protein fiber alternative or addative for livestock feed. Besides that Soybeans can also be processed into biofuels for disel engines. These crops are paramount to a myriad of U.S. and global industries.</p>
    <p>The current percieved problem facing both GMOs and climate change are people who are either unable or refuse to interpret data. This website is created in the hopes that whomever sees this site will atleast reconsider their stance on these two sensitive issues.</p>
